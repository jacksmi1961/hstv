## HomeSeer TV: Privacy policy

Welcome to HomeSeer TV (HSTV)!

HSTV is an Android TV app developed by Broken Road Software.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this application to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (e.g. Facility Layouts and HomeSeer credentials) is stored on your device in the application's private file store (i.e. it is not externally accessible). All data is erased when the application is uninstalled.

NOTE: HSTV does support the exporting of the Facility layouts to an SMB share folder. This action must knowingly be setup and performed by the user of the application. Any data exported in this manor becomes the responsibility of the user and the application no longer controls that data's destiny. Exported data will not be removed when the application is uninstalled.  

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | This is necessary for applications that use Android's Voice to Text function. Voice to Text is used to perform Voice Commands within the app. You, as the user, or the system, can revoke this permission at any time from Settings. Revoking this permission will, however, prevent voice commands from working. No data from Voice Commands is collected or stored by the app. |

This application also uses Android "Shortcuts". Shortcuts provide a quick method to perform complex actions in the app. These shortcuts can be triggered by a supported launcher or assistant, like Google Assistant, and help you quickly start common or recommended tasks within the app. NOTE: Most Android TV devices do not have a "supported launcher" at this time so this feature may not be avaiable on your TV device. However, it is still included in the application in the hope that Shortcuts are provided by Android TV at a future date. Again, no data is knowingly stored or collected by the app to support Shortcuts.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by this app, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
John Smith.
